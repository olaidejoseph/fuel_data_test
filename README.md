# fuel_data_test
Electric Utilities report a huge amount of information to government and public agencies. They include very granular data on fuel burned, electricity generated, power plant usage patterns, plant capacity factors and emissions from greenhouse gases. However, this data is not well documented and sometimes they are provided in a format that makes it difficult to understand.

In this repo, I worked  on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualisations on a public utility data containing millions of rows and tens of files in structured format. 
Afterwhich I attempted the quiz based on the fuel data. The solutions to my quiz are in this repo.
